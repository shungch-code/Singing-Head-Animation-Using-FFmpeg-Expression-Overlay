# Singing-Head-Animation-Using-FFmpeg-Expression-Overlay
FFmpeg facial animation focuses on combining a static head image with a set of predesigned facial expression layers, including eyebrows (neutral, angry, raised, sad), eyes (neutral, blinking, squinting, wide open), and mouth (neutral, angry, happy, sad).
üìò Overview
This repository provides all experimental resources for the paper ‚ÄúSinging Head Animation Using FFmpeg Expression Overlay.‚Äù
The project demonstrates a lightweight, fully reproducible workflow for generating expressive singing head animations using only FFmpeg commands and a small set of 2D facial expression layers.
Unlike 3D morphing or deep-learning approaches, this method composites static images (eyebrows, eyes, mouth) over a base head image to produce synchronized facial motion ‚Äî with no training data, no 3D modeling, and minimal computation.
üß© Features
Modular expression layering: Eyebrows, eyes, and mouth can be animated separately or jointly.
Lightweight workflow: Runs entirely through FFmpeg commands, no external animation software required.
Reproducible and open-source: All example files and scripts are included.
Real-time generation: Create expressive sequences in seconds on standard hardware.
